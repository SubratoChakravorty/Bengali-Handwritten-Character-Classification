# Bengali-Handwritten-Character-Classification
## Authors: Subrato Chakravorty, Aparna Srinivasan

### Description 
We try to identify the three grapheme elements - grapheme root, vowel diacritics, and consonant diacritics from images of handwritten Bengali graphemes, in order to accelerate the digitization of Bengali resources and promote research in Bengali character recognition. The proposed solution is modelled as a multi-task learning problem i.e., classify the three constituent elements in a grapheme - grapheme root, vowel diacritics, and consonant diacritics using a shared deep learning feature extraction module.

The dataset for this project is taken from a Kaggle Competition and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19/data).
